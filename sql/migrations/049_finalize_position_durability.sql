-- 049_finalize_position_durability.sql
-- Make NFL/NBA/football player position DURABLE across re-aggregation.
--
-- Bug (root of the 048 backfill): old event_box_scores.position is an EMPTY STRING
-- (not NULL), so finalize_fixture's `FILTER (WHERE e.position IS NOT NULL)` let '' through
-- and `position = COALESCE(EXCLUDED.position, player_stats.position)` treated '' as a real
-- value — so re-finalizing an old fixture would overwrite a good position (incl. the 048
-- backfill) with ''. Position would silently empty again, breaking the counting-stat pizza.
--
-- Fix (this migration redefines finalize_fixture): the position derivation now (a) ignores
-- empty-string event positions, and (b) falls back to players.meta->>'position_abbreviation'
-- when the event gives nothing — so a (re)aggregation of ANY season self-populates position
-- instead of emptying it. The ON CONFLICT also NULLIFs '' so a stale '' can't overwrite.
-- Applies to all three sports (the meta fallback is a no-op where meta lacks the key).
--
-- DDL only (no data change) — finalize_fixture REFRESHes materialized views CONCURRENTLY,
-- which can't run in a txn, so it isn't invoked here. The 048 backfill stays; this keeps it
-- from regressing. Position self-heals on each fixture's next finalize.
--
-- Apply with: psql "$DATABASE_PRIVATE_URL" -f sql/migrations/049_finalize_position_durability.sql
